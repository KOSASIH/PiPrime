# PiPrime Documentation
=====================

Welcome to PiPrime, a distributed system for calculating Pi to arbitrary precision!

Overview
--------

PiPrime is a scalable and fault-tolerant system that allows users to calculate Pi to arbitrary precision using a network of nodes. The system is designed to be highly available, scalable, and easy to use.

Components
----------

### PiPrimeModel

The PiPrimeModel is the core component of the system, responsible for calculating Pi to arbitrary precision. It uses a combination of algorithms and mathematical techniques to achieve high accuracy and performance.

### PiPrimeNode

The PiPrimeNode is a node in the PiPrime network that runs the PiPrimeModel. Each node is responsible for calculating a portion of Pi and communicating with other nodes to achieve the final result.

### PiPrimeClient

The PiPrimeClient is a client library that allows users to interact with the PiPrime network. It provides a simple API for sending requests to the network and receiving responses.

### PiPrimeServer

The PiPrimeServer is a server component that manages the PiPrime network. It is responsible for routing requests to available nodes, handling node failures, and ensuring the overall health of the network.

### PiPrimeNetwork

The PiPrimeNetwork is the network of nodes that work together to calculate Pi. It is responsible for distributing workloads, handling communication between nodes, and ensuring the integrity of the calculation.

Getting Started
-------------

### Building PiPrime

To build PiPrime, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/PiPrime.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Build the project: `python setup.py build`

### Running PiPrime

To run PiPrime, follow these steps:

1. Start the PiPrimeServer: `python pi_prime_server.py`
2. Start one or more PiPrimeNodes: `python pi_prime_node.py`
3. Use the PiPrimeClient to send requests to the network: `python pi_prime_client.py`

Configuration
-------------

PiPrime can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file. See the `config` directory for examples.

Benchmarks
----------

PiPrime provides a set of benchmarks to measure the performance of the system. See the `benchmarks` directory for more information.
